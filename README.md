Smart Job Matching and Recruitment System using Machine Learning
1. Project Overview
The Smart Job Matching and Recruitment System is an AI-powered web application designed to match resumes with the most relevant job opportunities using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The system analyzes resume text, compares it with job descriptions, and predicts the best matching jobs with confidence scores.
2. Features

Resume-to-job matching based on skill similarity

Match score prediction using Machine Learning

Dynamic ranking of jobs

Interactive and animated web interface

Supports multiple job domains

Uses synthetic labeled data generation for training

5. Dataset Details
The dataset contains job postings with the following columns:

 Job Title

 Description
The system combines both fields into one job_description column for processing.
6. Installation Guide
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run model training:
python train_model.py
Run the application:
python app.py
7. How It Works
1. User enters resume text.
2. Resume is combined with each job description.
3. TF-IDF converts text into numerical vectors.
4. Logistic Regression predicts match probability.
5. Top jobs are displayed with scores.
8. Machine Learning Workflow
Data Preprocessing

 Cleaning column names

 Removing duplicates

 Combining job title and description
Synthetic Label Generation

 Positive samples = matching job-resume pairs

 Negative samples = mismatched pairs
Feature Engineering

 TF-IDF Vectorization
Model Training

 Logistic Regression classifier
Prediction

 Match probability scoring
